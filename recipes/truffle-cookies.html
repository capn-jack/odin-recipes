    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A very dark, rich chocolate cookie for the true chocoholic. This recipe uses relatively little flour, resulting in dense, fudge-like cookies. These cookies keep well in the freezer (but you may have a hard time waiting for them to thaw before you eat them).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>6 Tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1&frac12; teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt unsweetened chocolate, 1 cup of the chocolate chips, and the butter stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. In a large bowl, whip eggs and sugar until thick and pale, about 2 minutes. Stir in the vanilla and the chocolate mixture until well mixed. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; gradually stir into the chocolate mixture. Fold in remaining 1 cup chocolate chips. Cover dough and chill for at least an hour or overnight. </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F (175&deg;C). Roll chilled dough into 1 inch balls. Place on ungreased cookie sheets so they are 2 inches apart. </li>
        <li>Bake for 9 to 11 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
