    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The classic buttery cookie coated with cinnamon sugar. But with this technique, you will get a thin and crispy cookie that you just can't resist. Perfect for dunking in a cup of tea or milk.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2&frac34; cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cream of tarter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup unsalted butter, at room temperature (1 stick or &frac14; pound)</li>
        <li>1&frac12; cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk or sift together flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl or the bowl of your mixer, cream the shortening, butter, and sugar at medium high speed thoroughly until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Reduce mixer speed to low, and slowly add the flour mixture. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Place dough in the refrigerator until just cool enough to handle and roll into balls, about 15&ndash;30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400&deg;F.</li>
        <li>Combine cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Using a small scoop or about 1 tablespoon of dough, form balls, and roll each ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture to coat all sides.</li>
        <li>Place dough balls about two inches apart on a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Just before baking, take your three middle fingers and press the balls down slightly, until they are about a half inch thick.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8&ndash;10 minutes, or until barely set and slightly golden. They will puff up at first while baking, then flatten out.</li>
        <li>Cool for a few minutes on the pan, then remove and cool completely on cooling racks.</li>
    </ol>
